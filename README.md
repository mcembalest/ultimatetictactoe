# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

To play, make sure `uttt.py` (main file), `uttt_window.py` (handles graphics) and `uttt_game.py` (handles game logic) are in the same folder. Then in the terminal, navigate to that folder and run

`python uttt.py`

which will launch the game in a TKinter window.


I originally read about this game from Ben Orlin's writing:
